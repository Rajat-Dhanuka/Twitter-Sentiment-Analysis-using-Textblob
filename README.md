# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis-using-Textblob

This project extracts the latest tweets (containing particular hashtags) and analyses their sentiment (positive, negative or neutral) and thus predicts the overall sentiment of the opinion people express on a particular matter

This helps us in getting a broad understanding of the current views and thoughts of an average person on the world affairs and other news.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86978037/181525765-c818647f-3ebe-4e8f-8101-3bf8bb880c67.png)
